# Mobile App Dev with iOS

This page contains the slides/resources you may need for our Mobile App Dev with iOS workshop.

* [Part 1](/part-1)
* [Part 2](/part-2)

## Get started

You'll need the following

* NodeJS
* PNPM

Installing them from [Volta](https://volta.sh) is the recommended way:

```shell
volta install node && \
volta install npm && \
volta install pnpm
```

The repository is set up as a PNPM workspace, so you'll only need to install dependencies once:

```shell
pnpm install
```

After which, you can start working on the content.
