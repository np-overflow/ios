## Get started

### Participant

Open the corresponding slides in the links above

### EXCO

You can edit the slides [here](https://github.com/np-overflow/ios)

You'll need the following

* NodeJS
* PNPM

Installing them from [Volta](https://volta.sh) is the recommended way:

```shell
volta install node && \
volta install npm && \
volta install pnpm
```

The repository is set up as a PNPM workspace, so you'll only need to install dependencies once:

```shell
pnpm install
```

After which, you can start working on the content.
